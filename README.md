## Installation

To run this package, navigate to my Github repository - [tskading](https://github.com/Tskading/README-Generator) - and clone the project.  From there, run 'npm i' in your intergrated terminal; this will install all dependent packages.  When complete, simply type 'node index.js' to run the program.  While running, you simply need to answer the prompts to get a custom README!  

Notes:  Your generated file will be named 'myREADME'.  You can copy this file and place it into your current project, then rename the file to just 'README'.  Also, as the application exists at this time, you will overwrite the contents every time you run the prompts.  So, make sure you save your copy if you are pleased with the work you've done.
